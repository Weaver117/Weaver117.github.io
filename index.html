                <p>
                    <strong> 1. Post a personal experience that you have with color and emotions. </strong>
                        <p> 
                            Color has always had a huge impact on me from a gaming standpoint. One of the most staple uses of color
                            in the gaming world is the usage of red around the edges of the screen to indicate that damage is being taken.
                            The red elicets an almost wincing reaction from the player. It is an excellent way to communicate damage being taken.
                            When this technique is not used, a very rare circumstance, the game simply does not feel as immersive. Another major color
                            related game mechanic is the health bar. Furthermore, anything that has to do with health in games ia almost exclusivly colored
                            red. Much like how the first mechanic I mentioned helped to make the player feel as if they were losing health, the color red in general
                            makes the player think of vitality. When you see a red potion in a game, it is almost always a health potion. This is basically a universal
                            rule. Same goes for blue potions being magic regeneration. The color red makes the player think of their health. I believe that it is because 
                            of the way that red makes the player feel. Red is vitality, red is danger, red is loud. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am half cuban and have lived my entire life in the United States. I am of two major cultures. On my fathers side I am 
                            American with all that implies in regards to culture. From my Mom's side I am Cuban, I have been deeply involved with my hispanic
                            heritage as i am interested in learning about it.
                            The color red has similar symbolism in both these cultures. It is the color of passion, energy, and vitality.
                            This alignes with the usage I mentioned above relating to the color in video game media. The color red symbolizes health
                            and the loss of it. It catches the eye, which makes it easy for the player to spot their health bar. It is an extremely 
                            versatile
                        </p>
                    <strong> 2. Share findings about a specific color’s meaning in another culture from
                        your own. Not mentioned in the slides. Elaborate and specify. </strong>
                        <p>
                            I decided to research the color red in Polish folklore. Poland, being an eastern bloc country, has a heavy
                            affiliation with communism. Thus, in their modern culture the color red and cimmunism are heavily intertwined.
                            However, in the more traditional folklore the color red symbolizes fertility and protection. It is interesting to 
                            see how the meaning of colors can be affected by the events a country is a part of. The traditional meaning of the 
                            color stays, but a new modern interpretation enters the picture as well. 
                        </p>
                    <strong> 3. Where in the real-world might color theory be applied to, NOT mentioned in
                        the slides or supplementary readings from the Web, where it can manipulate
                        people’s mood. Elaborate and specify. </strong>
                        <p>
                            One large way that color theory is applied in the 'real-world' is through signs. Whether we are discussing traffic 
                            signs or otherwise is not important as the use is prevalent in both. Traffic signs and lights in particular are 
                            perhaps the most prolific use of color theory in everyday life. Stop signs are a bright red, this color choice
                            beings instant attention to the driver. The light system also uses this system. Red means stop, the color is easy to 
                            interpret and makes the driver feel the need to stop. Green, being a more calm color that evokes 'flow' allows the driver 
                            to pass through the intersection. 
                        </p>
                    <strong>4. Post a link to a clip (or trailer) of an existing movie via Youtube (not
                        mentioned in the reading or Youtube clip I’ve provided) that showcases
                        successful color theory. Elaborate what the colors represent.</strong>
                        <p>
                            <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nulvWqYUM8k">Trailer Link</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I chose the Nosferatu 2024 trailer to showcase. The trailer, and the movie in general, use color theory
                            to create a uncomfortable and scary atmosphere. First and foremost the trailer uses lots of blues and blacks
                            to give the movie a bleak feeling. Moreover, the color palette, which resembles a bruise, generally makes the
                            audience feel uncomfortable. During the day time, the movie has a very flat palette, which only adds to the bleakness
                            that the director was trying to convey. Overall the trailer uses a flat and bleak color palette to bring the 
                            audience into the experience by making them feel off. 
                        </p>
                    <strong> 5. Why is it important to understand how a culture’s language can influence
                        those citizens’ perception of color? </strong>
                        <p>
                            Understanding how language can  influence a citizens perception of color is important for a multitude of reasons.
                            <br>
                            Firstly: Language is a persons tool to commnicate their feelings. If we can understand how someone's language can 
                            influence their perception of color, we can avoid misunderstandings. 
                            <br>
                            Second: From a more utilitarian and business savvy perspective, understanding the different perceptions of
                            color per language will greatly assist in how a company can maket it's products internationaly.
                            <br>
                            Third: Most importantly, understanding that perception is influenced by language helps to foster empathy
                            and broadens percpectives. It can help an individual to see and appreciate the diversity of human 
                            language and experience. Cultivating and encouraging respect for other cultures around the world.
